# Contents of `.env`

The `.env` file allows you to define environment variables that will be loaded
into the Ruby app, without the need to expose them system-wide. I don't know if
there's actually any security benefit in that, but it just makes managing
different servers and environments easier.

You should define the following values: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`
and `JWT_HMAC_SECRET`. The first one is required to interract with Google's
APIs, and the second one is where to connect to in order to store things in a
more permanent way. The last one is used to encrypt the JWT tokens that we
store on the client side. Example:

    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET='foobarzob'
    DATABASE_URL='sqlite://foo.db'
    JWT_HMAC_SECRET='random string of characters'

Please note the `.env` file is ignored during unit tests.
